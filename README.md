# E-Polling by Argumentation

## smartPOLL

The project aims to develop a system which integrates opinion polling and argumentation in order to empower individuals to render the reasoning behind their opinion explicit, using the novel QuAD-V (Quantitative Argumentation Debate for Voting) algorithm. This algorithm allows arguments to indirectly affect many other arguments in the poll, as opposed to naively only allowing arguments to directly affect some others. This would be done in a controlled dynamic setting, where polls can also be extended by individuals to incorpo- rate new statements that render their opinions coherent while at the same time helping to explain the reasoning behind them.
